While doing Lab1 I can't download MacOS and xCode for it because my computer was working very slowly and xCode needs a lot of memory usage.
So I decided to work with Android development using Android Studio and Java by using my initial operation system without downloading any virtual machines.
In Android Studio I didn't have any problems to complete this task.
